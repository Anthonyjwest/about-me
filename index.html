    <p>Hello, my name is Anthony Westerfield and I am 24 years old and live in Pennsylvania! My biggest interests are sports, video games, and music. I graduated high school, than attended college for a bit, but dropped out to obtain a real estate license. Ive worked numerous types of jobs from retail, to warehouses, and recently I worked in the animal care industry. I recently decided to try and find a more creative and lucrative career. Im very excited to be learning this skill and industry! My personal goal is to get a job within this industry while also creating solo projects on the side in my free time!  </p>
